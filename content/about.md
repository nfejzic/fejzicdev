# Welcome to the about page!

## So what is this website about?

This website is made for the sole purpose of showing the web development and javascript coding skills of the author. Basically it's purpose is to serve as a portfolio. Source code of the web page and all the projects is (or will be) available on GitHub as a repository.

It's heavily inspired by The Coding Train website, and this whole idea is inspired by the host of The Coding Train, Daniel Shiffman.

GitHub of this page available [HERE!](https://github.com/nfejzic/fejzicdev)
